NAME
    Test::Whitespaces - test source code for errors in whitespaces

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    In xt/whitespaces.t:

        use Test::Whitespaces;

    Running this test will check all files with the source code in the
    directories bin, lib, t and xt for errors in whitespaces. It will pretty
    print all the errors, so it is easy to fix them (by the way, this module
    ships with a script `whiter` that can automaticly fix all the errors).

    You can also customize the test. All parameters are optional.

        use Test::Whitespaces {
            dirs => [ 'script', 'lib' ], # Directories to check all the files from
            files => [ 'README' ],       # Additional files to check
            ignore => [ qr{\.bak$} ],    # Array with regexpex. Files that matches
                                         # that regexp are not checked
        };

  DESCRIPTION
    This module is intend to solve one simple task: to make sure that your
    source code don't have problems with whitespaces.

    This module checks that all the rules are followed.

    * Each line ends with "\n" (including the last line)
    * For new lines "\n" is used (not "\r\n")
    * There are no ending spaces on the lines
    * 4 spaces are used instead of tabs
    * No empty lines in the end of file

    This module don't export any subroutines, you only need to write a test
    file and write there:

        use Test::Whitespaces;

    More complex usage can be found in SYNOPSIS section.

    This module does not check the files that are stored in the version
    control system directories (you remember, that .git, .svn and friends).

    This module is shiped with 2 scripts. `test_whitespaces` to easy check
    files and directories and `whiter` to fix all that errors.

    And by the way, this module don't have any dependencies, but Perl. It
    does not matter much, but it is nice =)
